=========
This is a script that aims at randomly generating verses from Ennius Annals. It is inspired by Cicero's statement about atomist theories.

"He who believes this may as well believe that if a great quantity of the one-and-twenty letters, composed either of gold or any other matter, were thrown upon the ground, they would fall into such order as legibly to form the Annals of Ennius. I doubt whether fortune could make a single verse of them."
