Monkey Business 1.0 "Take that, Cicero !"
=========
This is a by-product of Existing Text Generator (https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo/issues/67), an unrealistic project submitted to NaNoGenMo.

This script  aims at randomly generating verses from Ennius Annals. It is inspired by Cicero's statement about atomist theories.

"He who believes this may as well believe that if a great quantity of the one-and-twenty letters, composed either of gold or any other matter, were thrown upon the ground, they would fall into such order as legibly to form the Annals of Ennius. I doubt whether fortune could make a single verse of them."
